    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "- The main difference is that NoSQL databases are more flexible and document-oriented(no table structure), whereas SQL database has a set number of rows and columns\n",
    "- Some forms of data are simply not a good fit for relational databases\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are better for unstructured data or big data (provide better operational speed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "- storing data about social media users, relationships and interactions\n",
    "- graph databases - offer structure that can store information about connections between users\n",
    "- this would be better than SQL database, because (1) the huge variety of relationships between users, (2) huge amount of data stored\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "-MongoDB is a flexible database containting key-value pairs, the data is stored as the value\n",
    "-the main difference from a relational database is that it does not have a fixed number of columns and fixed types of columns - each row can have its own columns and data types\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "- fault tolerant database is protected from data loss or providing incosistent information by distributing data among multiple servers. The servers contain each other's backups in case of server failure. \n",
    "- this also speeds up query times by distributing workload to more servers\n",
    "- RDD is a collection of such server clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "-MapReduce is a 2-step process of getting data from RDDs. We first ask the servers to run the query (MAP step) and then combine the results into a single aggreagate (REDUCE step).\n",
    "- Hadoop is a type of RDD\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
