The research study is looking to validate whether there is a statistical difference in the blood pressure of these two groups using a 5% significance level.  First, calculate the mean blood pressure of each of the two samples. Then, calculate the difference of these means. From there, use your `combT()` function, defined above, to generate all the possible combinations of the entire sample data into A-B splits of equivalent sizes as the original sets. For each of these combinations, calculate the mean blood pressure of the two groups and record the difference between these sample means. The full collection of the difference in means between these generated samples will serve as the denominator to calculate the p-value associated with the difference between the original sample means.\n",
